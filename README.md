# Bixen Challenge 6 Roller Splat Submission
 This is my Challenge 6 Submission


I did not click on ignore 'unity'. when first uploading my challenge 6 files to github, now I seem to have an error. I have removed  the initial commit from Github desktop, but every time I  Try to re-create a new repository in order to correctly submit Challenge 6,  it brings me back to the originally uploaded initial commit that keeps throwing up errors.
